# Web Dev Server Starter

This folder contains a npm project to be used as an optional starter template for a web project tutorial. It was created based on one of the [examples](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/example-projects) provided by the [Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev/) project. To use this folder as a starter template, copy/clone it to another folder and then *change directory* to the new folder. Once in the new folder, edit the file `package.json` as needed and then run the following command:

    npm install
